            <h2>Why 48 Roots?</h2>
            <p>
                48 Roots represents the year 1948, a pivotal moment in Palestinian history. Our name
                honors the resilience, strength, and enduring spirit of the Palestinian people.
                Every design we create tells a story of heritage, resistance, and hope.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We believe fashion can be a force for good. Through our Palestinian-inspired
                apparel, we aim to raise awareness, preserve culture, and directly support
                Palestinian families and communities. Every purchase you make contributes to
                rebuilding lives and creating opportunities.

            <h2>Quality & Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                We partner with Printify to ensure high-quality, ethically produced garments. Our
                print-on-demand model reduces waste and environmental impact, allowing us to focus
                resources where they matter most—supporting Palestine.
